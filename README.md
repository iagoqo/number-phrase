# Exercise description
*The task is to write a program that given any number between 0 and 1,000 inclusive, shows the grammatically-correct English phrase for this number (e.g. given 111 it shows "one hundred and eleven", given 21 it shows "twenty-one"). The code should be production ready and you can choose to complete the task using any technologies you want.*

I decided to make it work from 0 to 9999, since it was cleaner than just 1000.
