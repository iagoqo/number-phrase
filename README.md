# Exercise description
*The task is to write a program that given any number between 0 and 1,000 inclusive, shows the grammatically-correct English phrase for this number (e.g. given 111 it shows "one hundred and eleven", given 21 it shows "twenty-one"). The code should be production ready and you can choose to complete the task using any technologies you want.*

I decided to make it work from 0 to 9999, since it was cleaner than just 1000.



# Technologies used
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap
- Gulp
- Bower
- Yeoman
- Node.js
- NPM



# Usage

## Direct usage
The **dist** directory has all the files ready for production. You can copy it to a web server or just open the *index.html* file with your browser.

## Building the project
Use *gulp serve* to serve the files for development. Use *gulp serve:dist* to build the distribution files and serve those.

You must have *Node*, *Gulp* and *Bower* properly installed in order for the previous commands to work.
